Degree of Success: 99%
I Think that I completed this project almost entirely correct. I believe this
because when I was testing my program against the example given to us in the
homework assigment, all values came up as the correct values.

My main source of issue which I am still aware of within the program is that
I did not implement any code to account for any alignment issues caused by
numbers that take up to many characters on the screen.
